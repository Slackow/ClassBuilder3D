There will be strong emphasis on the important topic of security management. Topics here include security concepts and technologies, types of security attacks, encryption techniques, public key systems, Data Encryption Standard (DES), and authentication techniques. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), secure tunneling techniques, firewalls, Intranets, extranets, and VPN management are covered. The policy and regulatory issues in E-commerce are discussed. Finally, various E-commerce applications in the areas of finance, securities, trading, auctions, and travel are described. The course includes some E-commerce case studies and demonstrations.", "credits": "3", "prereqs": [], "distri": "Computer Engineering Program\r\n\r\nInformation and Data Engineering Program\r\n\r\nSchool of Business"}, {"course_id": "TM 621", "name": "Telecommunications Signaling and Switching", "description": "This course covers the technologies of switching systems for circuit, packet, and broadband-switched networks.  The focus of this course is switching systems instead of transmission systems.  Topics include: telephony switching, switching fabric architectures and analysis of their complexity, optical and photonic switching, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) for broadband networks. The various layers of ATM are investigated with switching fabric and architecture alternatives.  Included in this course is the study of high-speed packet networks based on Label Switching (MPLS) and their applications (e.g., VPN, Traffic Engineering).  Other related topics include IP telephony and its standards such as H.323, SIP, SGCP.  This course also covers circuit-switched network signaling used in user-to-network and network-to-network call control. Major topics include Common Channel Signaling System 7 (CCS7), Signaling Transfer Point (STP), ISDN User Part (ISUP), Transaction Capabilities Part (TCAP), and routing techniques.  The course will cover Inter-working of SS7 and IP Session Initiated Protocol (SIP), H.323 signaling protocol series. Included in the course are discussions on existing products in the industry such as Lucent Technologies' 5ESS, Ericsson's AXE10, Juniper's M160, Tellium's Aurora System.", "credits": "3", "prereqs": [], "distri": "School of Business"}, {"course_id": "TM 630", "name": "Broadband Networking: Services and Technology", "description": "This course provides a broad and comprehensive study of the technologies enabling broadband services and networking. High-speed network access technologies, core-network architectures, and the broadband service environment are the focus of this course. The broadband access technologies of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modem service, optical fiber- based access, and the high-speed wireless technology of LTE and 5G are examined and differentiated. The core-network technologies of MPLS, RSVP, DiffServe, as well as the services-converging IP Multimedia Sub-system (IMS) are discussed and studied as enabling technologies for broadband services. An overview is provided of key broadband services: VoIP, IPTV, streaming video and Video on Demand. The course concludes with a discussion of the opportunities and threats posed to service providers and the communications industry by the emerging disruptive technologies of broadband networking.", "credits": "3", "prereqs": ["TM 601", "TM 610"], "distri": "School of Business"}, {"course_id": "TM 631", "name": "Broadband Service Management", "description": "Broadband Service Management is a comprehensive course for those interested in deploying and operating broadband networks from a technical and managerial aspect.  A broadband networks success is based on its ability to deliver a desired service with a specific service requirement referred to as a Service Level Agreement (SLA).  The Service Level Management whether it is with an operator, infrastructure vendor, Third Party Vendor (3PV) or customer all have specific Key Performance Indicators (KPI) associated with them.  The ability to define, identify, and manage those Key Performance Indicators associated with a broadband network Service Level Agreement requires a thorough understanding of the entire broadband ecosystem.  The course will present key topics and criteria required to implement and sustain a network.  Emphasis will be placed on the ability to define performance quantities and manage the network balancing business risks while minimizing costs to meet the objectives of the broadband network.", "credits": "3", "prereqs": ["TM 630"], "distri": "School of Business"}, {"course_id": "TM 650", "name": "Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization", "description": "This course examines two important new network technologies and architectures; Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). These two closely related approaches are a direct response to the changing requirements to support new networking services in an integrated and flexible approach. The reason for each architecture is presented and their ability to meet the changing network requirements is examined. The architecture, standards, and applications for each is presented and studied. Each architecture is differentiated and compared and the potential interworking of each is considered. The course concludes with an introduction and study of the Internet of Things (IoT).

Issues of equipment acquisition, financing and accounting will be studied in depth. Additionally, the equipment/system selection process will use the techniques of probabilistic outcomes, simulation, sensitivity analysis and multi-attribute analysis to better define the risks and opportunities of these investments.  Also studied are telecommunications systems' effects on the balance sheet of the corporation as financial assets or liabilities; strategic assets, active revenue-producing tools or passive service provision in the corporation's realization of a business plan.", "credits": "3", "prereqs": [], "distri": "School of Business"}]
