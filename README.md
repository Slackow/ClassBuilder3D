Team Members: Ryan Johnson, Marvin Mody, Andrew Turcan, Miller Paule

Desc: A web app meant to assist with deciding on a schedule utilizing data from Workday.

Tech: Three.js, node.js, vite, React

Important Note: We didn't have time to make a proper deployment of our website, we ran it locally for the demo video. This is especially important since one aspect of our project relies on an API key (that we didn't want to include in the repo for obvious reasons).
